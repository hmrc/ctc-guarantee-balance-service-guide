<p>Learn how to use <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/1.0" rel="noopener noreferrer">CTC Guarantee Balance API v1.0</a> with your software.</p>
<h2 id="api-overview">API overview</h2>

<p>The CTC Guarantee Balance API is based on REST principles with endpoints that return data in JSON format and it uses standard HTTP error response codes.</p>
<p>Use the API to provide traders with up-to-date information about how much of their guarantee funds they have left to use when organising transit movements. Goods can be delayed if a trader&rsquo;s guarantee balance does not contain sufficient funds.</p>
<p>The API does not provide real-time data about a trader’s guarantee balance. Instead, the API provides a snapshot of the guarantee state at the time when a request is submitted. It is possible that a short delay could coincide with events that could change the trader’s balance information. Guarantee balance responses for a trader could become out of date quickly if the trader has a lot of transit movements progressing at the same time</p>
<p>The API endpoints relate only to Great Britain and Northern Ireland. You can also use the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/sandbox/introduction" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC sandbox environment</a> to run tests for Great Britain and Northern Ireland transit movements.</p>
<p>You can use the API on its own or you can use it with the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/1.0" rel="noopener noreferrer">CTC Traders API v1.0</a>, which enables your software to send departure and arrival movement notifications to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) and get messages sent from customs offices of departure and destination.</p>
<h3 id="ncts-guarantees-explained">NCTS guarantees explained</h3>

<p>If a trader moves goods between the UK and other countries that are part of the Common Transit Convention (CTC), their transit movements must have the appropriate guarantee funds to cover eventualities, such as the loss of goods during transit.</p>
<p>Consequently, each transit declaration sent to the NCTS must include guarantee details. The NCTS checks the guarantee reference number (GRN) quoted against the principal’s Trader Identification Number (TIN) and the declared access code. Any validation failures will cause a declaration to be rejected.</p>
<p>You can use more than one guarantee for a transit declaration if they are not comprehensive guarantees or guarantee waivers. A comprehensive guarantee or guarantee waiver that is not sufficient to cover a movement may be topped up by using an individual guarantee or vouchers.</p>

<ol>
<li>An IE34 request guarantee balance query is sent to NCTS and the XML is checked to ensure that it is valid. </li>
<li>An IE917 rejection message is returned to the user if the XML is invalid.</li>
<li>Valid XML is checked by GMS to validate that the guarantee reference number (GRN), trader tax ID number (TIN) and guarantee access pin (PIN) are correct. </li>
<li>If any of these are incorrect, an IE906 rejection message is returned to the user.</li>
<li>A validated GMS check returns a successful IE37 receive guarantee balance message to the user. </li>
