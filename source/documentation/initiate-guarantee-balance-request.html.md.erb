# Initiate a guarantee balance request

Use the POST endpoint [Send a balance request](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/1.0/oas/page#tag/ctc-guarantee-balance-api/operation/SendaBalanceRequest) of CTC Guarantee Balance API v1.0 to find out how much is left on a trader's guarantee balance.

To execute a balance query, you must provide:

- the trader identification number (TIN) of the principal on the guarantee
- the  guarantee reference number (GRN) of the traderâ€™s guarantee
- an access code for the guarantee, which is a 4-digit alphanumeric PIN that is not case sensitive

Guarantee balance information is available only for:

-  type 0: guarantee waiver
-  type 1: comprehensive guarantee
-  type 9: individual guarantee with multiple usage

Guarantee balance information is not supported for:

-  type 2: individual guarantee (by guarantor)
-  type 4: individual guarantee in the form of vouchers

For more information, see [HMRC guidance about NCTS guarantees](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-new-computerised-transit-system-supporting-guidance/ncts-guarantees).

JSON schema files and example requests are available in the [CTC Guarantee Balance API phase 4 testing guide](/guides/ctc-guarantee-balance-testing-guide/).
